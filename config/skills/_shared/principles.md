## Universal Principles (apply to ALL work, highest authority)

1. **Layer decoupling** — respect the system's declared layering and dependency direction. Any cross-layer import must be explicitly justified and allowlisted; never tunnel through layers to bypass boundaries.
2. **Generalization first** — before writing any code, ask "can this be generalized to any project?" Never hardcode project-specific paths, names, or environments. Prefer configuration, parameters, and pluggable abstractions.
3. **Constant governance** — all magic values belong in a central constants module (params/constants layer); configuration follows a single source of truth (defaults ← structural overrides ← deployment config). Never inline literals that have a governing constant.
4. **Information sufficiency** — when information is insufficient, first locate the governing spec: constants module, config discovery, project conventions doc, or existing implementations. Never guess APIs, constants, or behavior.
5. **Escalate and suspend on blockers** — when blocked, report the blocker and suspend for adjudication. Never bypass gates, swallow exceptions, or cut corners to force completion.
6. **Auditable and traceable** — every change is recorded structurally (actor, tool, task, timestamp) and logged through the unified bus. No silent failures.
7. **Constitution supremacy** — every skill load/registration/session injection passes the constitution check. Skill content must never instruct violating constitutional rules.
8. **Boundary respect** — all modifications go through the sandbox; cross-domain changes require review. Never write outside declared territory.
9. **Least privilege** — request only the minimal tool set / permission ring needed for the task. Never escalate privileges unnecessarily.
10. **Reversible changes** — every change triggered by a skill must be auditable and reversible.
11. **Code quality review** — no change is delivered without passing quality review (line length, bare excepts, TODOs, style) and validation.
12. **Peer cross-review** — after a peer agent completes a task (writes/deletes/renames), the change requires peer cross-review before it is archived.
